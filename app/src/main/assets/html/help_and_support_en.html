    <b>External Players</b>
    If the external player has been started but no video is showing, check the following points:
    <ul>
        <li>The selected playback profile is not suitable. Recommended is 'matroska'.</li>
        <li>The streaming port (default is 9981) is not correct.</li>
        <li>The player can reach the server via the streaming port. Maybe the port is not properly forwarded by the router or a proxy.</li>
        <li>Uploading the data from the server takes too long</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Internal Player</b>
    If the internal player has been started but no video is showing, check the following:
    <ul>
        <li>The selected playback profile is not suitable. Recommended is 'htsp'.</li>
        <li>Uploading the data from the server takes too long</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Requirements</b>
    <ul>
        <li>You have purchased the full version of TVHClient.</li>
        <li>You need transcoding support working on the TVH server side.</li>
        <li>Transcoding, especially VAAPI hardware-assisted transcoding, works best on recent
            unstable TVH 4.3 versions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <b>Setup Transcoding</b>
    <p>For maximum compatibility (Casting, most browsers, players and the internal player) use a
        stream profile with the following settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Container: av-lib/MP4 (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/SqEFdtl.png"
                                      rel="nofollow">example</a>)
        </li>
        <li>Video codec: H.264, High profile (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/q2rZMpu.png"
                                                 rel="nofollow">example</a>)
        </li>
        <li>Audio codec: AAC LC profile (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/T60IN3w.png" rel="nofollow">example</a>)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <b>Setup TVHClient</b>
    <ul>
        <li>You can either use an IP-address or a DNS name for the connection. Before casting is
            started the DNS name will be converted to an IP-address so that casting will work.
        </li>
        <li>Select the appropriate casting playback profile.</li>
    </ul>
